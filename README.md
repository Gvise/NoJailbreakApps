NoJailbreakApps
=================

TNN's code readily available to you. TNN is the new version of Sn0wCh1ld's NoJailbreakApps. (Sn0wCh1ld is formerly known as Smallcut Powers.) NJA/TNN is a place online where you can use the Safari browser on your iOS device to install a variety of apps.

If you re-release TNN anywhere, you must give me credit in your code and on the modified site as "Sn0wCh1ld" and include the link to my Twitter at https://twitter.com/Sn0wCh1ld .

I released this for free, and it would help to make NJA way better if you donated using the button below. The work you would have to do to make it better would be greatly decreased. I need $15, I currently have $3.27.  Thanks in advance!
